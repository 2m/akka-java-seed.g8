## Full example code

Here below is the complete source code from the three classes, `Greeter`, `Printer` and `AkkaQuickstart`, that creates the sample application:

### Greeter.java

@@snip [Greeter.java]($g8src$/java/com/lightbend/akka/sample/Greeter.java)

### Printer.java

@@snip [Printer.java]($g8src$/java/com/lightbend/akka/sample/Printer.java)

### AkkaQuickstart.java

@@snip [AkkaQuickstart.java]($g8src$/java/com/lightbend/akka/sample/AkkaQuickstart.java)

As another best practice we should provide some test coverage.
